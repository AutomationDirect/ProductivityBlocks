# ProductivityBlocks

ProductivityBlocks is an open source block programming tool for the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/OldSoftwareReleases). The application is primarily designed to program a [P1AM-100 CPU](https://www.automationdirect.com/adc/shopping/catalog/programmable_controllers/open_source_controllers_(arduino-compatible)/productivityopen_(arduino-compatible)/controllers_-a-_shields/p1am-100) with the [P1AM-100 library](https://github.com/facts-engineering/P1AM), but it may also be used to program other Arduino boards supported by the Arduino IDE.

ProductivityBlocks is based on the [ardublock](https://github.com/taweili/ardublock) project.

To learn more about this application, please see the [ProductivityBlocks Wiki](https://github.com/AutomationDirect/ProductivityBlocks/wiki).
